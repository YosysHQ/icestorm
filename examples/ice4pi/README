Assuming you are running on a Raspberry Pi 2-4 or Zero (tested with bullseye):

1. Install all necessary packages to synthesize rot.v and build bit image (rot.bin) for the ice4pi:

 sudo apt-get install yosys fpga-icestorm arachne-pnr flashrom
 sudo apt-get install spi-tools
 make

2. Make sure your Pi has SPI enabled (e.g. use raspi-config)

3. Load the example.bin file to the shield:

 sudo make load

---

4. Validate spi loopback:


echo -n 0123456789ABCDEF | spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.1 -s 10000000

You should get back 
F0123456789ABCDE

(F may be NUL if this is your first call)
